Vision Behavior
-------------

Once the bot has driven to the correct distance, detect the best pair of targets (a pair of horiz and vert targets, found on either side of the goal).
If the target is hot, shoot. If not, wait until 5 seconds into the auto period (at which time the hot goal switches) and shoot.
